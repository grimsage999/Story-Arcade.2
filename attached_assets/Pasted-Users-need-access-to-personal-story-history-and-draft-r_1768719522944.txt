Users need access to personal story history and draft recovery across sessions.

REQUIREMENT: Add persistent draft storage, personal story library, and export features.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
1. Auto-save drafts to localStorage:
   - Every 10 seconds during scene creation
   - Structure: { draftId, storyTitle, currentScene, userInputs: [5 slots], createdAt, lastSavedAt }
   - Display auto-save status: "Auto-saved just now" (update in real-time)
   - If save fails: show warning notification (3 sec): "Draft save failed - check connection"

2. Create persistent DRAFTS section:
   - New tab/page accessible from navigation
   - Display saved drafts in list format:
     ```
     [Story Title] [Scene 2/5] - Created 2h ago
     [CONTINUE] [DUPLICATE] [DELETE]
     ```
   - Pagination for 10+ drafts (10 per page)
   - Sort by: [Most Recent] [Oldest] [Alphabetical]
   - Allow renaming draft: click title to edit inline

3. Draft recovery on startup:
   - Check localStorage for incomplete drafts on app load
   - If draft exists from < 24 hours ago, show modal:
     ```
     "Welcome back! Found an unsaved story: 'The Meteor Legend' (Scene 3/5)"
     [RESUME] [DISCARD] [NEW STORY]
     ```
   - Auto-dismiss if user has no recent drafts

4. MY STORIES personal library:
   - New navigation item: [MY STORIES]
   - Display all completed stories created by this user
   - Card layout: [Story title] [Date created] [Theme tags] [View/Edit/Export]
   - Sort by: [Newest First] [Most Liked] [Alphabetical]
   - Pagination: 10 stories per page
   - Search bar: "Search your stories..."
   - Filter by theme: [All] [HOPE] [GRIT] [MYSTERY] etc.

5. Export functionality on completed stories:
   - Add button group on story page: [EXPORT]
   - Dropdown menu options:
     - [📄 Download as PDF] - styled PDF with story text, themes, ID, timestamp
     - [📋 Copy to Clipboard] - plain text version ready for pasting
     - [🔗 Copy Story Link] - shareable URL with story ID (for EXPLORE)
     - [📸 Generate Card] - creates social media preview image (title + opening quote)

6. localStorage key structure:
   - "storyArcade_drafts": array of all drafts
   - "storyArcade_completed": array of published stories (synced with server if available)
   - "storyArcade_settings": user preferences (theme, language, etc.)
   - Max storage: 5MB (warn user if approaching limit)
   - Auto-cleanup: delete drafts older than 30 days

7. Service Worker for offline access:
   - Cache completed stories locally (offline-readable)
   - Show "📡 Offline Mode" indicator when no connection
   - Allow viewing completed stories but disable creation/publishing
   - Sync drafts when connection restored

Use browser's IndexedDB for scale (> 1000 stories), fall back to localStorage for < 100.
Add "Clear all drafts?" confirmation before deletion.
